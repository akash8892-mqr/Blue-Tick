# Blue-Tick
Blue Tick is a research-driven system for identifying inauthentic activity on social platforms. It analyzes text patterns, posting behavior, profile metadata, image consistency, and network interactions to detect signals commonly associated with fake, automated, or manipulated accounts. Rather than acting as a black box, it exposes explainable scoring outputs and evidence trails to support transparency and analysis.
The platform includes:


Feature extraction modules for language style, sentiment cues, posting frequency, profile completeness, engagement anomalies, and media integrity checks


Hybrid scoring engine combining lightweight machine learning with interpretable heuristics


Dashboard interface for exploring account risk profiles and activity timelines


API endpoints for integration into moderation pipelines or external applications


Dataset tools for training, evaluation, and benchmarking


Exportable reports to assist audits, academic research, and digital forensics


Blue Tick is engineered for students, researchers, fact-checking initiatives, and developers exploring trust and safety systems. It is not intended for surveillance or invasive user profiling; the focus is on technical experimentation, academic learning, and fostering safer online communities.
